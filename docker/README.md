# Docker (Planned)

This directory will hold **sanitized Docker Compose templates** used inside Service VM(s).

Status: planned — no production stacks committed yet.

## Conventions (when added)
- `docker/stacks/<name>/compose.yml` committed
- `.env.example` committed
- real `.env` files are not committed (gitignored)
- no credentials/tokens/keys in this repository
